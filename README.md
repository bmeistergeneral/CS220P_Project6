# CS220P_Project6
This project is an implementation of a binary search tree in terms of insertion, searching, 
calculating height, printing, and counting total nodes and leaf nodes. This binary search tree
doesn't have a deletion method to delete nodes. Each node is listed in the order they were inserted,
but it could be improved to be represented in a 2D vertical or sideways fashion. It considers the rules
of a binary search tree in that the left child of the parent node is smaller than its parent, and the
right child of the parent node is larger than its parent. The parent node could be the root node or an 
internal node. Each node must have at most two children. Considering the rules, I think this is a successful
implementation but not perfect nonetheless.
